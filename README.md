## **About Me**
Hi! My name is Anthony but most people call me AJ. My journey in the world of coding has been driven by curiosity and a love for creating fun yet practical projects. I have hands-on experience with both front-end and back-end technologies, allowing me to navigate through the full development process.
When I'm not coding, I enjoy camping, playing guitar, and spending time with my wife and dogs.

## **Tech Stack**

- React.js, Next.js, Three.js
- Node.js, Express.js, Python, Flask
- PostgreSQL, SQL, Mongodb
